# FileManager
Prueba solicitada
This project was created on Visual Studio 2022.

This projects resembles a FIle Manager, so you can view and explore all files.
You can Rename, Copy or Move the file between different directories.

You can only Move or Copy one file per time, doing it other way could send an exception.

I would appreciate any feedback.

Thanks!
